                Hello, I&apos;m Victor. After 5+ years of being the go-to tech person for friends, family, and small businesses, I started Private IT Support to bring clear, friendly, and effective tech help to everyone who needs it.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                I specialize in solving the tech problems that slow you downâ€”whether that&apos;s a computer that takes forever to start up, Wi-Fi that keeps dropping, or the anxiety of dealing with suspicious emails. My approach is simple: no jargon, no runaround, just honest answers and real solutions that work.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800">
                I love helping entrepreneurs focus on their business instead of tech headaches, and individuals feel confident using their devices. Every client gets personalized attention and solutions that fit their specific needs and budget.
